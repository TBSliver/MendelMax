# MendelMax #
These are all the design files im using for building my MendelMax, including the BOM and all .stl files.

## Design Choices ##
The main frame uses the MendelMax 1.5 frame, with a slightly different Y-Idler which comes in 3 parts instead of 2. The X Axis and X Carriage used are the same as the Blomker kits of MendelMax, and the Y Carriage hasnt quite been finalised yet. The Y Holder bars are a compact version to allow electronics underneath the bed.
